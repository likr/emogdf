/**
 * The class SchnyderLayout represents the layout algorithm by
 * Schnyder [Sch90]. This algorithm draws a planar graph G
 * straight-line without crossings. G must not contain self-loops or
 * multiple edges.
 * The grid layout size is (<i>n</i> − 2) × (<i>n</i> − 2) for a graph with
 * n nodes (<i>n</i> ≥ 3).
 * The algorithm runs in three phases. In the ﬁrst phase, the graph is
 * augmented by adding new artiﬁcial edges to get a triangulated plane graph.
 * Then, a partition of the set of interior edges in three trees
 * (also called Schnyder trees) with special orientation properties is derived.
 * In the third step, the actual coordinates are computed.
