 * node gets at least two neighbors. Additionally, the edge (\a x,\a y) is inserted.
 *
 * The neighbors are distributed such that a neighbor of \a v becomes
 *   - only a neighbor of \a x with probability \p p1;

 *
 * The probability for a neighbor to be moved to both split nodes is
 * 1.0 - \p p1 - \p p2. The higher this probability, the higher the density
